description: The aim of this project was to paint dot an image using the Emika Franka Panda 7 DOF robotic arm. The system utilizes computer vision and color detection to identify the location of the brushes and various paint colors on a palette. The robot then plans and excecutes trajectories using a custom MoveIt API.
