                        Hello! I'm Fiona, a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University. My research focuses on assistive robotics, 
                        specifically in the assessment of human-robot interaction and the development of assistive technology for individuals with disabilities. 
                        I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame (G' Irish!) in 2022. I started my PhD at NU 
                        in September of 2022 where I am currently being advised by Dr. Brenna Argall. In Spring of 2024 I was awarded the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship which I will use to fund the remainder of my PhD. 
                        Outside of my research, I am passionate about reading, baking, rock climbing, open-water swimming, music and Notre Dame football!
